            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Introduction">Introduction</h2><br>
            <p>Pluto is a complex and mysterious world with mountains, valleys, plains, craters, and maybe glaciers.
                Discovered in 1930, Pluto was long considered our solar system's ninth planet. But after the discovery
                of similar intriguing worlds deeper in the distant Kuiper Belt, icy Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf
                planet. <br><br>

                Pluto is orbited by five known moons, the largest of which is Charon. Charon is about half the size of
                Pluto itself, making it the largest satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system.
                Pluto and Charon are often referred to as a "double planet." <br><br>

                Pluto is named after the Roman god of the underworld.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Exploration">Exploration</h2><br>
            <p><b>New Horizons:</b> New Horizons launched on Jan. 19, 2006; it swung past Jupiter for a gravity boost
                and
                scientific studies in February 2007, and conducted a six-month-long reconnaissance flyby study of Pluto
                and its moons in summer 2015, culminating with Pluto closest approach on July 14, 2015. As part of an
                extended mission, pending NASA approval, the spacecraft is expected to head farther into the Kuiper Belt
                to examine another of the ancient, icy mini-worlds in that vast region, at least a billion miles beyond
                Neptune’s orbit. <br><br>

                Sending a spacecraft on this long journey is helping us to answer basic questions about the surface
                properties, geology, interior makeup and atmospheres on these bodies.</p> <br><br>

            <div class="newhorizons responsiveAspect"></div><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Size_and_Distance">Size and Distance</h2><br>
            <p>With a radius of 715 miles (1,151 kilometers), Pluto is about 1/6 the width of Earth. If Earth was the
                size of a nickel, Pluto would be about as big as a popcorn kernel. <br><br>

                From an average distance of 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers), Pluto is 39 astronomical units
                away from the sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the sun to Earth.
                From this distance, it takes sunlight 5.5 hours to travel from the sun to Pluto. <br><br>

                If you were to stand on the surface of Pluto at noon, the sun would be 1/900 the brightness it is here
                on Earth, or about 300 times as bright as our full moon. There is a moment each day near sunset here on
                Earth when the light is the same brightness as midday on Pluto. Find out when you can experience "Pluto
                time" where you live.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Orbit_and_Rotation">Orbit and Rotation</h2><br>
            <p>Pluto's orbit around the sun is unusual compared to the planets: it's both elliptical and tilted. Pluto's
                248-year-long, oval-shaped orbit can take it as far as 49.3 astronomical units (AU) from the sun, and as
                close as 30 AU. (One AU is the mean distance between Earth and the sun: about 93 million miles or 150
                million kilometers.) But on average, Pluto is 3.7 billion miles (5.9 billion kilometers) away from the
                sun, or 39 AU. <br><br>

                From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was near perihelion, when it is closest to the sun. During this time, Pluto was
                actually closer to the sun than Neptune. <br><br>

                One day on Pluto takes about 153 hours. Its axis of rotation is tilted 57 degrees with respect to the
                plane of its orbit around the sun, so it spins almost on its side. Pluto also exhibits a retrograde
                rotation; spinning from east to west like Venus and Uranus.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Formation">Formation</h2><br>
            <p>Dwarf planet Pluto is a member of a group of objects that orbit in a disc-like zone beyond the orbit of
                Neptune called the Kuiper Belt. This distant realm is populated with thousands of miniature icy worlds,
                which formed early in the history of our solar system about 4.5 billion years ago. These icy, rocky
                bodies are called Kuiper Belt objects, transneptunian objects, or plutoids.</p>
            <br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Structure">Structure</h2><br>
            <p>Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth's moon and probably has a rocky core surrounded by a
                mantle of water ice. Interesting ices like methane and nitrogen frost coat its surface. Due to its lower
                density, Pluto's mass is about one-sixth that of Earth's moon.</p><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Surface">Surface</h2><br>
            <p>Pluto's surface is characterized by mountains, valleys, plains, and craters. The temperature on Pluto can
                be as cold as -375 to -400 degrees Fahrenheit (-226 to -240 degrees Celsius). <br><br>

                Pluto's mountains can be as tall as 6,500 to 9,800 feet (2 to 3 kilometers) and are big blocks of water
                ice, sometimes with a coating of frozen gases like methane. And long troughs and valleys as long as 370
                miles (600 kilometers) add to the interesting features of this faraway dwarf planet. <br><br>

                Craters as large as 162 miles (260 kilometers) in diameter dot some of the landscape on Pluto, with some
                showing signs of erosion and filling. This suggests tectonic forces are slowly resurfacing Pluto.
                <br><br>

                The most prominent plains observed on Pluto appear to be made of frozen nitrogen gas and show no
                craters. These plains do show structures suggesting convection (blobs of material circulating up and
                down).

            </div>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Atmosphere">Atmosphere</h2>
            </h2><br>
            <p>Pluto has a thin, tenuous atmosphere that expands when it comes closer to the sun and collapses as it
                moves farther away—similar to a comet. The main constituent is molecular nitrogen, though molecules of
                methane and carbon monoxide have also been detected. <br><br>

                When Pluto is close to the sun, its surface ices sublimate (changing directly from solid to gas) and
                rise to temporarily form a thin atmosphere. Pluto's low gravity (about six percent of Earth's) causes
                the atmosphere to be much more extended in altitude than our planet's atmosphere. Pluto becomes much
                colder during the part of each year when it is traveling far away from the sun. During this time, the
                bulk of the planet's atmosphere may freeze and fall as snow to the surface.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Potential_for_life">Potential for Life</h2><br>
            <p>The surface of Pluto is extremely cold, so it seems unlikely that life could exist there. At such cold
                temperatures, water, which is vital for life as we know it, is essentially rock-like. Pluto's interior
                is warmer, however, and some think there could even be an ocean deep inside.
            </p><br> <br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Moons">Moons</h2><br>
            <p>Pluto has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. This moon system might have formed by
                a collision between Pluto and another similar-sized body early in the history of the solar system.
                <br><br>

                Charon, the biggest of Pluto's moons, is about half the size of Pluto itself, making it the largest
                satellite relative to the planet it orbits in our solar system. It orbits Pluto at a distance of just
                12,200 miles (19,640 kilometers). For comparison, our moon is 20 times farther away from Earth. Pluto
                and Charon are often referred to as a double planet. <br><br>

                Charon's orbit around Pluto takes 153 hours—the same time it takes Pluto to complete one rotation. This
                means Charon neither rises nor sets, but hovers over the same spot on Pluto's surface. The same side of
                Charon always faces Pluto, a state called tidal locking. <br><br>

                Pluto's other four moons are much smaller, less than 100 miles (160 kilometers) wide. They're also
                irregularly shaped, not spherical like Charon. Unlike many other moons in the solar system, these moons
                are not tidally locked to Pluto. They all spin and don’t keep the same face towards Pluto.
            </p><br> <br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Rings">Rings</h2><br>
            <p>There are no known rings around Pluto.
            </p><br><br>

            <h2 class="m-heading" id="Magnetosphere">Magnetosphere</h2><br>
            <p>It isn't known whether Pluto has a magnetic field, but its small size and slow rotation suggest little or
                none.​
